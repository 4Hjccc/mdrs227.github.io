The MDRS 227 crew is an international crew selected by the [Mars Society](https://www.marssociety.org/). Our team will travel to the [Mars Desert Research Station](https://mdrs.marssociety.org/about-the-mdrs/) in April 2020 to help put humans on Mars. We are engineers, physicians, sociologists, biologists, and journalists who hail from all walks of life and seven nations. But most of all, we are explorers.
